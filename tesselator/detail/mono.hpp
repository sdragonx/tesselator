 * loop of half-edges (see mesh.h) oriented CCW.  "Monotone" in this
 * case means that any vertical line intersects the interior of the
 * region in a single interval.
 *
 * Tessellation consists of adding interior edges (actually pairs of
 * half-edges), to split the region into non-overlapping triangles.
 *
 * The basic idea is explained in Preparata and Shamos (which I don''t
 * have handy right now), although their implementation is more
 * complicated than this one.  The are two edge chains, an upper chain
 * and a lower chain.  We process all vertices from both chains in order,
 * from right to left.
 *
 * The algorithm ensures that the following invariant holds after each
 * vertex is processed: the untessellated region consists of two
 * chains, where one chain (say the upper) is a single edge, and
 * the other chain is concave.  The left vertex of the single edge
 * is always to the left of all vertices in the concave chain.
 *
 * Each step consists of adding the rightmost unprocessed vertex to one
 * of the two chains, and forming a fan of triangles from the rightmost
 * of two chain endpoints.  Determining whether we can add each triangle
 * to the fan is a simple orientation test.  By making the fan as large
 * as possible, we restore the invariant (check it yourself).
